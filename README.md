This is a script to help you get magnet links to your favorite movie!

Here is how it works: 
* Step 1: Find the movie you wish to get with the date it was released
* Step 2: in terminal/command prompt type the movie name with the year
* Step 3: Get your download link saved to a file called movies.csv

I have been working on this script fro 2 days not all bugs are fixed
